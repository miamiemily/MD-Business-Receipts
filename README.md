Miami-Dade County Business receipts

I am interested in creating a map of this data that can be used for analyzing the business environment at a neighborhood level.

I have been working on geocoding the data with ArcGIS. My first attempt was only partially successful. I need to find a different address locator.

I have done some basic stats from the data using statistical software (SPSS) including frequencies and cross-tabs for some of the categorical variables. I you have suggestions let me know and I will run them.
